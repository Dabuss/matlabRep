function [c,ceq] = IKConstraints(x,vrep_store,obstacles,maxDeflections,forceCapa)


% x                     are the positions in redundancy space
% tasks                 gathers all the tasks that are to be
%                       performed by the robot without moving the mobile
%                       plateform. Along the pose (expressed in the world
%                       reference frame), a force vector is given to
%                       describe the kind of interaction and provide
%                       information for the deflection and forceCapacity
%                       solvers.
% obstacles             gathers the geometry of obstacle objects
% maxDeflections        gathers the maximal accepted deflections at the end
%                       effector. Multiple directions can be contrained.
%                       Rotations and translation must be treated
%                       separately
% Additional remarks : joint limits will be hardcoded
%
% Goal : Provide non-linear contraints for matlab fmincon solver. IK is
% resolved analytically out of chosen positions in redundancy space (x) and
% a number of tasks (tasks). 
% 
% 1) For each task, reachability is checked 
% 2) For each task, an analytical IK is then performed to compute q
% 3) For each task, the computed q is checked to lie within the joint
% limits
% 4) For each task, the FK of each link is computed and a computation of
% the distance to obstacles is performed
% 5) For each task, the deflections are computed 
% 6) For each task, the force Capacity is computed


% x = [x_b, y_b, theta_b, swivel_1, swivel_2, ... , swivel_m] where x_b and
% y_b are the x_w and y_w coordinates (in the world reference frame) of the
% base of the robot and theta_b is the angle taken by the plateform about
% z_w
%
% tasks = {task_1, task_2, ... task_m} where task_m0 contains at least the
% associated pose_m0 where the task occurs and wrench_0 which describes the
% force interaction occuring at task_m0 with the environment. 
%   the task is given with ZYX euler convention
%
% obstacles {obstacle_1,obstacle_2, ... , obstacle_o} where obstacle_o0 is
% a structured way of describing the obstacles
%
% maxDeflections = {deflection_1, deflection_2, ... , deflection_d}
% where deflection_d0 contains a vector along which the deflection is
% limited to the norm of the vector (I don't know how to integrate
% rotative deflections though)
%
% forceCapa = {forceCapa_1, forceCapa_2, ... , forceCapa_f}
% where forceCapa_f0 contains a vector along which the force capacity must
% be allowed
